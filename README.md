# Sentiment_Analysis_BERT

This repository contains code for sentiment analysis using BERT-based model and Transformers library to predict sentiments from text reviews. The model is fine-tuned for sentiment classification and can be used to analyze sentiments of reviews in multiple languages.

# Description
Sentiment analysis is the process of determining the emotional tone behind a series of words, and it has various applications in natural language processing. This project demonstrates how to perform sentiment analysis using a pre-trained BERT-based model and Transformers library. The BERT model used here is 'nlptown/bert-base-multilingual-uncased-sentiment', which is specifically designed for multilingual sentiment analysis tasks.
